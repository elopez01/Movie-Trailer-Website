# Movie Trailer Website

A Movie Trailer Website where users can see some of my favorite movies and learn a bit more information about them.
 
# Required Libraries and Dependencies

Python 2.x is required to run this project. The Python executable should be in your default path, which the Python installer should have set.
 
# Quick Start

  - Download the code
  - Open the text-based interface for your operating system (e.g. the terminal window in Linux, the command prompt in Windows).
  - Navigate to the project directory and type in the following command:
     - **python entertainment_center.py**
  - Your default browser should launch a new tab displaying the movie trailer website.
  - This will open up a page in your web browser
  - Hover over the Movie Tile to view trailer or on the "About Movie" to learn more about the movie (Linked to wiki)

# Project Contents

Excluding this `README.md` file there are three python files:
  - **fresh_tomatoes.html** - HTML file created from entertainment_center.py.
  - **entertainment_center.py** - The main entry to the program. Builds the movie list and calls the method to generate
   the web page.
  - **fresh_tomatoes.py** - The provided web page generator. It takes in a list of movies and builds the `HTML` and opens up
  your default browser to display the generated `HTML` page.
  - **media.py** - Contains the class that provides the data structure to hold movie information.
  
  # NOTE
  
 I have included the compiled versions of the files above as well.
