# Movie Trailer Website

A Movie Trailer Website where users can see some of my favorite movies and learn a bit more information about them.
 
# Quick Start

  - Download the code
  - Open terminal and cd to the extracted folder
  - Run the application, `fresh_tomatoes.html`
  - This will open up a page in your web browser
  - Hover over the Movie Tile to view trailer or on the "About Movie" to learn more about the movie (Linked to wiki)

# What's included

Excluding this `README.md` file there are three python files:
  - **fresh_tomatoes.html** - Where you can view the website on any browser.
  - **entertainment_center.py** - The main entry to the program. Builds the movie list and calls the method to generate
   the web page.
  - **fresh_tomatoes.py** - The provided web page generator. It takes in a list of movies and builds the `HTML` and opens up
  your default browser to display the generated `HTML` page.
  - **media.py** - Contains the class that provides the data structure to hold movie information.
  
  # NOTE
  
 I have included the compiled versions of the files above as well.
